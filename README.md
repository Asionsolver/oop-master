## Disadvantage of Procedural Programming

Procedural Programming is good, but there is some serious issue we face to programming seems really hard when it comes to procedural programming like C.

1. Code is not reusable.
2. Large code base is hard to manage.
3. Difficult to tracing & fixing bugs.
4. Data is exposed to whole program.
5. Here, operation's priority is higher than data.
6. Difficult to relate with real world data.

OOP:

```java
Public String name
Public String email
Public String password
Public String username

User createUser (data) {};
void login(data) {};
void logout() {};
void resetPassword(data) {};
```

- Now User is a Template or Constructor Function
- We can call User function as many time as we want.
- Each time we call User a new User will be create. For example: new User(data)

```java
User user1 = new User(data);
User user2  = new User(data)
```

## Class is a template to create multiple Object

- Class i a Blueprint to create multiple Object.

## Object Oriented Programming is all about Object

- Anything that need multiple attributes or multiple primitives to define.
- Object is king in OPP.

## Every Thing as a Object

![cat](./img/cat.png)

## What is an Object?

1. Combination of Noun, Adjective & Verb.
   ![cat-2](./img/cat-2.png)
   ![car](./img/car.png)
2. A Capsule that can encapsulate data & operations.
3. Has some private and public properties.
4. Has some functions which is called methods.
5. Is a custom data type.
6. An isolated environment for properties & method.
